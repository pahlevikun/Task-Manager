      summary: System Health Check
      description: |
        Checks the operational status of the application and its dependencies (Database) for liveness/readiness purposes.
        
        **Access Control:**
        This endpoint is restricted to internal access only (Docker/Pod network).
        Need to setup one the API gateway/load balance so requests from public IP addresses will be rejected.
